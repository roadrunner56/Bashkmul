	description "Barely able to be held up by your average Rigran, the Bazooka Blaster fires rounds that any other species would consider excessive in hand-to-hand combat. The blast is almost strong enough to rip a hole through the interior of a ship, a fact not helped by its poor aim and high recoil. Despite these drawbacks, the Bazooka Blaster is extensively used in boarding and capture operations, as its sheer power ensures that one hit will be enough to take out its target instantly."
