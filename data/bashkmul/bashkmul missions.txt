			`The first thing you notice about this ringworld is that the Quarg seem to be a minority here, at least in the part of this ringworld open to visitors. Many, if not most of the inhabitants here are aliens you have not seen before: large, four-legged creatures with shaggy brown fur and large paws. Despite the less-than-warm welcome you recieved when you entered this space, you do not sense any hostility from these aliens; in fact, they do not seem to even notice your presence. They move at a languid pace, and the scene is almost peaceful until you hear a loud shout.`
			`	"Aigh! Po ku ye ti!"`
			`	You turn around to see a small, greenish blur sprint towards you on all fours. Once it approaches you, they stand up on their hind legs, reaching no higher than your chest. They are quite lanky in appearance, with thin limbs covered in tough scales. Their large eyes bulge out of either side of their gilled head, which itself is crowned by fins reaching along the spine and down their tail. "You are human, yes?" they say in a heavily accented voice.`

				`	"Yes."`
					goto yes
				`	"I don't understand what you're saying."`

			`	The creature waves your query away. You can see that their hands are webbed. "Not important. You... fly in our space with jump drive?"`
				goto choice
			label annoyed
				`	The creature scrunches up its face in frustration. "You... are... human... yes?" it says, louder and slower this time.`

					goto language

			`	"You... fly in our space with jump drive?"
			label choice
			choice
				`	"Yes, that's how I got here."`
				`	"No, I don't have a jump drive."`
				`	"Can I speak to a Quarg?"`
			`	Almost the second you finish talking you hear a deep voice next to you. "Salutations, visitor." You look over to find a Quarg observing you both.`
			`	"I see you have found yourself in the space of the Bashkmul," it says. To your side you can see the small alien grimace and slouch. You can't tell whether this is in anger or fear. "Mos flet me te neri! Ti nuk ye bashk!" they say to the Quarg. It slowly blinks its eyes.
			`	"There appears to be some confusion. You must excuse us for a moment." It crouches down towards the small creature and begins a vigorous debate. Finally, the Quarg turns to you. "The Bashkmul demand that you give up your jump drive if you wish to leave their space alive," it says, apparently unperturbed by this information.
			choice
				`	"Are you going to just let them do that?"`
				`	"What if I leave and bring back more jump drives?"`
					goto negotiation
			`	The Quarg sighs. "We will not allow any harm to come to you as long as you reside on our ringworld." It places a particular emphasis on 'our', and you wonder if the Bashkmul picks up on this. "However, we cannot interfere with the decisions of the Bashkmul government. Our relations with them are precarious as is. We are unable to guarantee your safety if you leave our space.`
			choice
				`	"What if I leave and bring back more jump drives?"`
					goto negotiation
				`	"Okay, I'll give up my jump drive."`
					die
				`	"I'm not giving up my jump drive!"`
			`	"The Bashkmul, due to their... unique situation, value jump drives very highly. Simply put, traveling here with a jump drive makes you a target. I would advise leaving as soon as possible, unless you are somehow able to come to an agreement with the Bashkmul." The small alien looks at you, its teeth slightly bared.`
			choice
				`	"What if I leave and bring back more jump drives?"`
					goto negotiation
				`	"Okay, I'll give up my jump drive."`
					die
				`	"I'm getting out of here. No one's getting their hands on my jump drive."`
					goto nuhuh
			label negotiation
			`	The Quarg narrows its eyes. "This may perhaps put you in a more favorable light with the Bashk-"`
			`	"More? Have you more jump drives?" the small alien interrupts. A gleam in their yellow eyes becomes clearer. "If bring you more jump drives, then maybe we can make peace. Come to Mernoth by <date>, and we will talk with leaders."`
			choice
				`	"And what if I refuse?"`
					goto refuse
				`	"Leaders?"`
					goto leaders
				`	"Alright, I'll go."
					####put a more in-depth response here
					accept
				`	"No, I won't go."
			label nuhuh
			`	The Bashkmul squints and mutters something in their own language. They then take out some sort of communications device. "You are not welcome in our space." They give a bitter smirk as they walk away.`
			#####This should send a fleet after you and make you permanently hostile to the Bashkmul
				decline

					goto nuhuh
			label leaders
			`	"With Bashkmul..." they struggle to find an adequate word. "With group of voted people." You sense that this is the best explanation that you'll be able to get until you go to Mernoth.`

			`It is an unusally rainy day at <planet>'s spaceport. You struggle to find a place to land, but that is not only due to the cloud cover. A sizable crowd has formed; most of them appear to be of the same species as the alien who you talked to on <source>. Upon landing, your ship is quickly surrounded by guards in uniforms, who appear to be from both species you saw on the ringworld. A booming voice rattles the inside of your ship.`
			`	"For the Rigra and Aert which make up the Bashkmul, we demand you exit from your ship."`

			`	Upon leaving your ship, you are taken by the guards towards a building that you imagine was more impressive in its heyday. For now though, you walk through the creaking hallways and warped doors to a	large atrium filled with what are presumably representatives of the Bashkmul government. Most of them are the fish-like aliens, but the one who speaks to you is the large, four-legged creature you recognize from the ringworld.`
			`	"I must apologize for the less than warm welcome you have recieved. Our more... able diplomats were not prepared for your sudden visit." Their voice has a deep baritone quality, and their speech is slow and almost labored. Neither its tone nor its stony expression betrays any sort of emotion, at least not any that you can discern. "We have been told that you can give us multiple jump drives in exchange for safe passage through our space."`
			choice
				`	"Who are you?"`
				`	"Why do you want jump drives so badly?"`
				`	"Yes, I can bring more jump drives to you."`
					goto yes
			`The creature sighs. "I am an Aert. Our planets, our stars, were mangled by a species called the Pug. We united with the Rigra-" they gesture towards the fish aliens who make up most of the crowd in the building, "-fought the Pug off, and formed the Bashkmul. But our stars remained broken and our planets began to die. Though we are connected to Rigra space, there remain few untouched places there. We must look beyond our space for a new home."
			`	A Rigran beside him speaks up. "But this is not the time for stories. Our ultimatum is this: come back here with 5 jump drives in 50 days, or forfeit your one jump drive now."`

			`Almost as soon as you hit the tarmac, you are surrounded with ships and guards - most of them seem preoccupied with keeping a large crowd of civilians at bay. You direct an Aert towards your hold, and 5 jump drives are carted off your ship. You wonder if that's the end of it when you feel a tapping on your back.`
			`	"Frankly, I did not expect you to come back." You turn around to see the Rigra you met upon first visiting Mernoth. "I was against letting you go, personally. I now see that I was wrong." He sighs. "You have done a great service to the Aert, more than you can understand."`

			`	The Rigra snorts and looks away. "That is not funny," he says. "If you are done playing, you can meet me in the spaceport and I will tell you more about the Bashkmul." He looks towards the large crowd. "This place, it is perhaps not best for discussion."`
