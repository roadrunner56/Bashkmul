			`The first thing you notice about this ringworld is that the Quarg seem to be a minority here, at least in the part of this ringworld open to visitors. Many, if not most of the inhabitants here are aliens you have not seen before: large, four-legged creatures with shaggy brown fur and large paws. Despite the less-than-warm welcome you recieved when you entered this space, you do not sense any hostility from these aliens; in fact, they do not seem to even notice your presence. They move at a languid pace, and the scene is almost peaceful until you hear a loud shout.`
			`	"Aigh! Po ku ye ti!"`
			`	You turn around to see a small, green alien sprint towards you on all fours. Once it approaches you, they stand up on its hind legs, reaching no higher than your chest. "You are human, yes?" they say in a heavily accented voice.`
			choice
				`	"Yes."`
					goto yes
				`	"I don't understand what you're saying."`
					goto annoyed
				`	"How do you know my language?"`
			label language
			`	The creature waves your query away. You can see that their hands are webbed. "Not important. You... fly in our space with jump drive?"`
				goto choice
			label annoyed
				`	The creature scrunches up its face in frustration. "You... are... human... yes?" it says, louder and slower this time.`
			choice
				`	"Yes."`
				`	"How do you know my language?"`
					goto language
			label yes
			`	"You... fly in our space with jump drive?"
			label choice
			choice
				`	"Yes, that's how I got here."`
				`	"No, I don't have a jump drive."`
				`	"Can I speak to a Quarg?"`
			`	Almost the second you finish talking you hear a deep voice next to you. "Salutations, visitor." You look over to find a Quarg observing you both.`
			`	"I see you have found yourself in the space of the Bashkmul," it says. To your side you can see the small alien grimace. You can't tell whether this is in anger or fear. "Mos flet me te neri! Ti nuk ye bashk!" they say to the Quarg. It slowly blinks its eyes.
			`	"There appears to be some confusion. You must excuse us for a moment." It crouches down towards the small creature and begins a vigorous debate. Finally, the Quarg turns to you. "The Bashkmul demand that you  give up your jump drive if you wish to leave their space alive," it says, apparently unpertrubed by this information.
			choice
				`	"Are you going to just let them do that?"`
				`	"What if I leave and bring back more jump drives?"`
					goto negotiation
			`	The Quarg sighs. "We will not allow any harm to come to you as long as you reside on our ringworld." It places a particular emphasis on 'our', and you wonder if the Bashkmul picks up on this. "However, we cannot interfere with the decisions of the Bashkmul government. Our relations with them are precarious as is. We are unable to guarantee your safety if you leave our space.`
			choice
				`	"What if I leave and bring back more jump drives?"`
					goto negotiation
				`	"Okay, I'll give up my jump drive."`
					die
				`	"I'm not giving up my jump drive!"`
			`	"The Bashkmul, due to their... unique situation, value jump drives very highly. Simply put, traveling here with a jump drive makes you a target. I would advise leaving as soon as possible, unless you are somehow able to come to an agreement with the Bashkmul." The small alien looks at you, its teeth slightly bared.`
			choice
				`	"What if I leave and bring back more jump drives?"`
					goto negotiation
				`	"Okay, I'll give up my jump drive."`
					die
				`	"I'm getting out of here. No one's getting their hands on my jump drive."`
					goto nuhuh
			label negotiation
			`	The Quarg narrows its eyes. "This may perhaps put you in a more favorable light with the Bashk-"`
			`	"More? Have you more jump drives?" the small alien interrupts. A gleam in their yellow eyes becomes clearer. "If bring you more jump drives, then maybe we can make peace. Come to Mernoth by <date>, and we will talk with leaders."`
			choice
				`	"And what if I refuse?"`
					goto refuse
				`	"Leaders?"`
					goto leaders
				`	"Alright, I'll go."
					####put a more in-depth response here
					accept
				`	"No, I won't go."
			label nuhuh
			`	The Bashkmul squints and mutters something in their own language. They then take out some sort of communications device. "You are not welcome in our space."`
			#####This should send a fleet after you and make you permanently hostile to the Bashkmul
				decline
			label refuse
			`	"Then your ship, we disable and board," they say simply."`
			choice
				`	"Leaders?"`
					goto leaders
				`	"Alright, I'll go."`
					accept
				`	"No, I won't go."`
					goto nuhuh
			label leaders
			`	"With Bashkmul..." they struggle to find an adequate word. "With group of voted people." You sense that this is the best explanation that you'll be able to get until you go to Mernoth.`
			choice
				`	"And what if I refuse?"`
					goto refuse
				`	"Alright, I'll go."`
					accept
				`	"No, I won't go."`

			`It is an unusally rainy day at <planet>'s spaceport. You struggle to find a place to land, but that is not only due to the cloud cover. A sizable crowd has formed; most of them appear to be of the same species as the alien who you talked to on <source>. Upon landing, your ship is quickly surrounded.`
			`	"For the Rigra and Aert which make up the Bashkmul, we demand you exit from your ship."`
