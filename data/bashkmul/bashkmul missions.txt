			`The first thing you notice about this ringworld is that the Quarg seem to be a minority here, at least in the part of this ringworld open to visitors. Many, if not most of the inhabitants here are aliens you have not seen before: large, four-legged creatures with shaggy brown fur and paws. Despite the less-than-warm welcome you recieved when you entered this space, you do not sense any hostility from these aliens; in fact, they do not seem to even notice your presence. About the size of a large horse, they move at a languid pace, and the scene is almost peaceful until you hear a loud shout.`
			`	"Aigh! Po ku ye ti!"`
			`	You turn around to see a small, greenish blur sprint towards you on all fours. Once it approaches you, they stand up on their hind legs, reaching no higher than your waist. They are quite lanky in appearance, with thin limbs covered in tough scales. Their large eyes bulge out of either side of their gilled head, which itself is crowned by fins reaching along the spine and down their tail. Their overall appearance gives you the impression of a humanoid fish. "You are human, yes?" they say in a heavily accented voice.`

			`	Almost the second you finish talking you hear a deep voice next to you. "Salutations, visitor." You look over to find a Quarg observing you both.`
			`	"I see you have found yourself in the space of the Bashkmul," it says. To your side you can see the small alien grimace and slouch. You can't tell whether this is in anger or fear. "Mos flet me te neri! Ti nuk ye bashk!" they say to the Quarg, who responds only by slowly blinking its eyes.
			`	"There appears to be some confusion. You must excuse us for a moment." It crouches down towards the small creature and begins a vigorous debate. Finally, the Quarg turns to you. "The Bashkmul demand that you give up your jump drive if you wish to leave their space alive," it says, apparently unperturbed by this information.
			choice
				`	"Are you going to just let them do that?"`
				`	"What if I leave and bring back more jump drives?"`
					goto negotiation
			`	The Quarg sighs. "We will not allow any harm to come to you as long as you reside on our ringworld." It places a particular emphasis on 'our', and you wonder if the Bashkmul picks up on this. "However, we cannot interfere with the decisions of the Bashkmul government. Our relations with them are precarious as is. We are unable to guarantee your safety if you leave our space.`

I would advise leaving as soon as possible, unless you are somehow able to come to an agreement with the Bashkmul." The small alien looks at you, its teeth slightly bared.`

			`It is an unusally rainy day at <planet>'s spaceport. You struggle to find a place to land, but that is not only due to the cloud cover. A sizable crowd has formed; most of them appear to be of the same species as the alien who you talked to on <source>. Upon landing, your ship is quickly surrounded by guards in uniforms, who appear to be from both species you saw on the ringworld. A booming voice rattles the inside of your ship.`

			`	Upon leaving your ship, you are taken by the guards towards a building that you imagine was more impressive in its heyday. For now though, you walk through the creaking hallways and warped doors to a	large atrium filled with what are presumably representatives of the Bashkmul government. Most of them are the fish-like aliens, but the one who speaks to you is the large, four-legged creature you recognize from the ringworld.`
			`	"I must apologize for the less than warm welcome you have recieved. Our more... able diplomats were not prepared for your sudden visit." Their voice has a deep baritone quality, and their speech is slow and almost labored. Neither its tone nor its stony expression betrays any sort of emotion, at least not any that you can discern. "We have been told that you can give us multiple jump drives in exchange for safe passage through our space."`

We united with the Rigra-" they gesture towards the fish aliens who make up most of the crowd in the building, "-fought the Pug off, and formed the Bashkmul. But the stars in Aert space remained broken and our planets began to die. Though we are connected to Rigra space, there remain few untouched places there. We must look beyond our space for a new home."

			`Almost as soon as you hit the tarmac, you are surrounded with ships and guards - most of them seem preoccupied with keeping a large crowd of civilians at bay. You direct an Aert towards your hold, and 5 jump drives are carted off your ship. You wonder if that's the end of it when you feel a tapping on your back.`
			`	"Frankly, I did not expect you to come back." You turn around to see the Rigra you met upon first visiting Mernoth. He is looking at the ground, with his paws clasped behind his back. "I was against letting you go, personally. I now see that I was wrong." He sighs. "You have done a great service to the Aert, more than you can understand."`

			`The weather in the spaceport is uncomfortably hot and humid, a condition not helped by the massive crowd surrounding you. Most of the crowd is made up of Rigra, but the few Aert you see stand out simply by virtue of their size. The spaceport is a cacophony of conversations, arguments, haggling, music, and more than the occasional shout your way. You soon realize that you would probably not be able to pick the Rigran diplomat out of the surrounding crowd. Just as you consider going back, you turn around to see him running on all fours towards you.`
			`	"Captain!" He straightens up and smooths down the cloak he is now wearing. "Come with me. I am sure you have many questions."`
			`	You follow him to what looks like a large sewage drain, albeit one with a rather ornate cover. He opens a lock on the door, and you begin walking down a warmly-lit hallway. The air is surprisingly misty, and you notice humidifiers installed along the walls. Eventually you reach a doorway with two doors embedded within each other in a manner reminiscent of a dog door; the larger one fills up the entire doorway and is about the size of an Aert, while the smaller one barely reaches your shoulder. The Rigra diplomat enters through the smaller doorway.`
			choice
				`	(Enter through the smaller door.)`

				goto laugh

			`	You crouch down and try to squeeze yourself through the narrow doorway, only making it through after a considerable amount of time and effort.`
			label laugh
			`	You look up to see the Rigra at a desk, struggling to hold back laughter. The sound of his laugh is high-pitched, almost like birdsong.`
			`	"Apologies, our facilites are not made for someone of your stature," he says, regaining composure. The whole office is filled with furniture either far too large or far too small for you; the effect is disorienting. You sit down on the nearest chair, which is uncomfortably tiny. You notice it has a hole in the back, presumably to accomodate the tails of the Rigra.`
			`	"Now, I realize that you do not know my name. In the interest of keeping my identity easy to remember with you, I have selected a human name for use. Please, call me Darwin."`
			`	You decide to refrain from making any jokes about fish that grew legs.`

			`	Darwin's face darkens. "Yes. They are responsible for the current troubles in Aert space." Darwin leans back in his chair. He can't be taller than a meter. "Many years ago, we first made contact with the Aert. Our contact was peaceful, despite our overwhelming technological and military superiority." Fins on the side of his head flare out. "War only broke out between us when an agricultural plague struck our worlds, and we were forced to take one of their farming planets to feed our people. The Pug decided to intervene by playing with our stars, threatening to destroy them if we did not submit to their authority. We and the Aert united against them, forming the Bashkmul, and drove them off. But the stars in Aert space, they were not repairable even by the Pug. We believe they intended to fix them once the war was over, but they for whatever reason were unable to, or perhaps decided not to. You are familiar with Pug?"`
			choice ### add option for those players who haven't completed FW yet.
				`	"Yes, humanity was at war with the Pug. I helped fight them off."`
				`	"They invaded our space and cut off our hyperlanes, but they never touched our stars."`
			`	Darwin's eyes widen in what you guess is an expression of shock. "So we are not the only species that have been subject to their evil ways. This must have been recent, as we have no record of Pug in human space."`
			choice
				`	"What do you mean, 'records'?"`
				`	"How do you know about humanity?"`
					goto language
			label language
			`	"You are not first human that has arrived in our space, although you are first surviving this long. You are also first we were able to communicate with. The only other human who arrived here was killed for her jump drive, as we could not negotiate the trade of more jump drives like we did with you. However, we found a data chip on her person, from your 'Library of Alexandria'. We learned about your species and your language from this data, so that if we ever encountered another human traveler we could communicate properly. Thankfully my training has not gone to waste." He smiles.`

			`	"Because of the Pug's games, the stars in Aert space have an accelerated lifespan. Simply put, their stars are expanding and heating up, and this has rendered many parts of their planets uninhabitable. The Aert, their space is not extensive, and ours is... not currently suitable for them. Some have chosen to live with us despite the conditions on many of our planets, but a few chose to travel to the west of our space.`
				goto choice
			label morejd
			`	Darwin's eyes narrow, and he leans forward. "You really are not joking me, are you? You realize how serious this is to us." His eyes dart across the room and a frog-like tongue jumps out of his mouth, trapping an insect that was flying by your face moments ago. He swallows it and continues. "If you ever have more jump drives to give us, meet me here. I am authorized to give rewards out to anybody who can do so.`
				goto choice
			label translator
			`	Darwin tilts his head slightly in what you assume is a display of confusion. "Translator? Can you not simply... Ah, I forget. For you humans, difficult it is for you to learn languages when you are old. We Rigra do not use translators - we have many languages among us selves, but we pick them up as a young human does. A few Rigra have even tried to learn the human language for fun. Perhaps you will run into them." He leans back. "I am... 32, in your years, and feel the weight of my age, but I am still able to gain a working knowledge of your speech quite easy. It is unfortunate you cannot do the same. The Aert are similar in that regard. We have no translator for you, but you can try to get by on our planets with your games of 'charades', or hope you can meet a Rigra that speaks your language. "`

He pauses and his eyes narrow. "That is... unwise." He appears to chew on something before continuing. "We have fortunately not met these Alphas before. If we find them we will destroy them before they can become a threat to us as they have been to you."`
