			`The first thing you notice about this ringworld is that the Quarg seem to be a minority here, at least in the part of this ringworld open to visitors. Many, if not most of the inhabitants here are aliens you have not seen before: large, four-legged creatures with shaggy brown fur and paws. Despite the less-than-warm welcome you recieved when you entered this space, you do not sense any hostility from these aliens; in fact, they do not seem to even notice your presence. About the size of a large horse, they move at a languid pace, and the scene is almost peaceful until you hear a loud shout.`
			`	"Aigh! Po ku ye ti!"`
			`	You turn around to see a small, greenish blur sprint towards you on all fours. Once it approaches you, they stand up on their hind legs, reaching no higher than your chest. They are quite lanky in appearance, with thin limbs covered in tough scales. Their large eyes bulge out of either side of their gilled head, which itself is crowned by fins reaching along the spine and down their tail. Their overall appearance gives you the impression of a humanoid fish. "You are human, yes?" they say in a heavily accented voice.`

				`	"Yes, that's how I got here."`
				`	"No, I don't have a jump drive."`
				`	"Can I speak to a Quarg?"`
			`	Almost the second you finish talking you hear a deep voice next to you. "Salutations, visitor." You look over to find a Quarg observing you both.`
			`	"I see you have found yourself in the space of the Bashkmul," it says. To your side you can see the small alien grimace and slouch. You can't tell whether this is in anger or fear. "Mos flet me te neri! Ti nuk ye bashk!" they say to the Quarg, who responds only by slowly blinking its eyes.
			`	"There appears to be some confusion. You must excuse us for a moment." It crouches down towards the small creature and begins a vigorous debate. Finally, the Quarg turns to you. "The Bashkmul demand that you give up your jump drive if you wish to leave their space alive," it says, apparently unperturbed by this information.
			choice
				`	"Are you going to just let them do that?"`
				`	"What if I leave and bring back more jump drives?"`
					goto negotiation
			`	The Quarg sighs. "We will not allow any harm to come to you as long as you reside on our ringworld." It places a particular emphasis on 'our', and you wonder if the Bashkmul picks up on this. "However, we cannot interfere with the decisions of the Bashkmul government. Our relations with them are precarious as is. We are unable to guarantee your safety if you leave our space.`

					goto okay
				`	"I'm not giving up my jump drive!"`
			`	"The Bashkmul, due to their... unique situation, value jump drives very highly. Simply put, traveling here with a jump drive makes you a target. I would advise leaving as soon as possible, unless you are somehow able to come to an agreement with the Bashkmul." The small alien looks at you, its teeth slightly bared.`

			`It is an unusally rainy day at <planet>'s spaceport. You struggle to find a place to land, but that is not only due to the cloud cover. A sizable crowd has formed; most of them appear to be of the same species as the alien who you talked to on <source>. Upon landing, your ship is quickly surrounded by guards in uniforms, who appear to be from both species you saw on the ringworld. A booming voice rattles the inside of your ship.`

			`	Upon leaving your ship, you are taken by the guards towards a building that you imagine was more impressive in its heyday. For now though, you walk through the creaking hallways and warped doors to a	large atrium filled with what are presumably representatives of the Bashkmul government. Most of them are the fish-like aliens, but the one who speaks to you is the large, four-legged creature you recognize from the ringworld.`
			`	"I must apologize for the less than warm welcome you have recieved. Our more... able diplomats were not prepared for your sudden visit." Their voice has a deep baritone quality, and their speech is slow and almost labored. Neither its tone nor its stony expression betrays any sort of emotion, at least not any that you can discern. "We have been told that you can give us multiple jump drives in exchange for safe passage through our space."`

			`"I am an Aert. Our planets, our stars, were mangled by a species called the Pug. We united with the Rigra-" they gesture towards the fish aliens who make up most of the crowd in the building, "-fought the Pug off, and formed the Bashkmul. But the stars in Aert space remained broken and our planets began to die. Though we are connected to Rigra space, there remain few untouched places there. We must look beyond our space for a new home."

			`Almost as soon as you hit the tarmac, you are surrounded with ships and guards - most of them seem preoccupied with keeping a large crowd of civilians at bay. You direct an Aert towards your hold, and 5 jump drives are carted off your ship. You wonder if that's the end of it when you feel a tapping on your back.`
			`	"Frankly, I did not expect you to come back." You turn around to see the Rigra you met upon first visiting Mernoth. "I was against letting you go, personally. I now see that I was wrong." He sighs. "You have done a great service to the Aert, more than you can understand."`

			`The weather in the spaceport is uncomfortably hot and humid, a condition not helped by the massive crowd surrounding you. Most of the crowd is made up of Rigra, but the few Aert you see stand out simply by virtue of their size. The spaceport is a cacophony of conversations, arguments, haggling, music, and more than the occasional shout your way. You soon realize that you would probably not be able to pick the Rigran diplomat out of the surrounding crowd. Just as you consider going back, you turn around to see him running on all fours towards you.`
			`	"Captain!" He straightens up and smooths down the cloak he is now wearing. "Come with me. I am sure you have many questions."`
			`	You follow him to what looks like a large sewage drain, albeit one with a rather ornate cover. He opens a lock on the door, and you begin walking down a warmly-lit hallway. The air is surprisingly misty, and you notice humidifiers installed along the walls. Eventually you reach a doorway with two doors embedded within each other in a manner reminiscent of a dog door; the larger one fills up the entire doorway and is about the size of an Aert, while the smaller one barely reaches your shoulder. The Rigra diplomat enters through the smaller doorway.`

			`	You crouch down and try to squeeze yourself through the narrow doorway, only making it through after a considerable amount of time and effort.`
			label laugh
			`	You look up to see the Rigra at a desk, struggling to hold back laughter. The sound of his laugh is high-pitched, almost like birdsong.`
			`	"Apologies, our facilites are not made for someone of your stature," he says, regaining composure. "Now, I realize that you do not know my name. In the interest of keeping my identity easy to remember with you, I have selected a human name for use. Please, call me Darwin."`
			`	You decide to refrain from making any jokes about fish that grew legs.`

			`	Darwin's face darkens. "Yes. They are responsible for the current troubles in Aert space." Darwin leans back in his chair. He can't be taller than a meter. "Many years ago, we first made contact with the Aert. Our contact was peaceful, despite our overwhelming technological and military superiority. War only broke out between us when an agricultural plague struck our worlds, and we were forced to take one of their farming planets to feed our people. The Pug decided to intervene by playing with our stars, threatening to destroy them if we did not submit to their authority. We united against them, forming the Bashkmul, and drove them off. But the stars in Aert space, they were not repairable, even by the Pug. You are familiar with Pug?"`

				`	"Yes, humanity was at war with the Pug. I helped fight them off."`
				`	"They invaded our space and cut off our hyperlanes, but they never touched our stars."`
			`	"So we are not the only species that have been subject to their evil ways. This must have been recent, as we have no record of Pug in human space."`

					goto language
			label language
			`	"You are not first human that has arrived in our space, although you are first surviving this long. You are also the first we were able to communicate with. The only other human who arrived here was killed for her jump drive, as we could not negotiate the trade of more jump drives like we did with you. However, we found a data chip on her person, from your 'Library of Alexandria'. We learned about your species and your language from this data, so that if we ever encountered another human traveler we could communicate properly. Thankfully my training has not gone to waste." He smiles.`
