	description "While turrets are not commonly used by Rigra captains, who generally prefer the flexibility and speed of a gun, the Hammerstrike turret has found a niche among captains wanting a longer range and higher damage than its gun version."

	description "Recently developed, the Dagger is a new laser design from the Rigra that was originally intended for mining but quickly became repurposed as a weapon. A favorite among pirates and privateers alike, the Dagger makes it easier to capture or loot a ship without destroying it in combat."
	description "The traditional Rigra emphasis on blaster weapons has made it so that only recently have beam weapons been seriously developed, and as such the Dagger possesses a relatively low damage for its size."

	description "The Plague Cannon is a simple assembly system. Plague Barrels are loaded into the launching tube, where a rudimentary guidance system and rocket booster are strapped onto it, before being launched at high speeds towards the enemy. While its damage potential is massive, the corrosive nature of Plague Paste often destroy disabled ships before any boarding action can be attempted."


outfit "Plague Barrel"
	category "Ammunition"
	cost 1400
	thumbnail "outfit/torpedo"
	"mass" .4
	"barrel capacity" -1
	description "Taking advantage of the immense amount of toxic and corrosive byproducts produced by Rigran industrial processes, the Plague Barrel weaponizes a condensed mixture of these compounds to produce a projectile capable of eating through a ship's hull. Specially made casings, the Barrels, are designed in such a way that the mixture contained within is splattered on the largest possible area after impact."
	description "The weapon thus has the dual effect of removing chemical pollution while providing a cheap source of weaponry to the Bashkmul, and the state of many Rigran planets means that the ultimate source of Plague Barrels won't be exhausted anytime soon."

	ammo "Torpedo"
	description "Because of the dangerous nature of Plague Barrels and the lax quality control standards of the Rigra, this ammunition requires a specialised storage system to avoid corrosion of your ship."

	description "While its efficiency is questionable when compared to similar systems elsewhere, the Turtle Anti-Missile remains the only one available to the Bashkmul. While most Rigra view the Turtle as a waste of good weapons space, it is popular among Aert captains wishing to increase the safety and security of their passengers and cargo."
