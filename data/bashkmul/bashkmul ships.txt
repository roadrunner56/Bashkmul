	description "The brief history of Aert spaceflight has been mainly focused on moving cargo and people in bulk. The Detoh is a reflection of the former goal."
	description "As the Rigra do not have any large cargo ships currently in production, the Detoh is sometimes used by Rigra captains despite its frail hull and non-existent shielding. These downsides are less of a dealbreaker for the Aert, as their space's lack of any real piracy makes strong defensive armaments unnecessary. However, its poor speed and maneuverability make it an especially frustrating ship for Rigra captains to pilot."

	description "Mainly used as a support ship by Bashkmul military forces, the Trident is able to field a dizzying number of fighters. While designed to carry Slingshots, some civilian Rigra captains instead carry Coffers, transforming the Trident into a capable freighter. The flexibility of being able to switch out Coffers for Slingshots, or vice versa, have made it popular with Rigra captains who want a versatile ship that is equally capable of carrying cargo as it is hunting pirates."

	description `The Coffer is an older Rigra design, back when pirate attacks were rare and an alien invasion seemed unthinkable. Formulated as an alternative for those captains focused on carrying cargo rather than bounty hunting, the Coffer is used to transform the Trident into a large freighter without raising heat levels to an unmanageable amount. Some more daring captains even use this fighter as their flagship, adding a hyperdrive to turn it into a ship able to carry a high density of cargo for its size. This high density comes at a cost, however - the cockpit, already quite cramped even by the standards of the Rigra, is almost impossible for a human pilot to fit in.`
	description "	Fighters do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a fighter unless you have a ship in your fleet with a fighter bay."

	description "The rather lax safety standards of the Rigra are evident in the design of the Slingshot, a ship notorious for its emphasis on speed over survivability. The cheap, lightweight materials that make up the Slingshot allow it to be fielded in overwhelming numbers, which besides its maneuverability is about the only advantage it has in combat."

	description "The Rigra approach to warfare is to hit fast, hit hard, and then get away before your victim can hit back.

	description "As Rigra space became increasingly unstable and dangerous, the need arose for a merchant ship that was able to withstand pirate attacks. The Fortress has both ample cargo and weapons space, allowing it to function both as a freighter and as a defensive platform. This versatility has also made it popular with the very pirates it was meant to defend against.`

	description "First seeing use after the Pug War, the Howitzer is a joint Rigra-Aert design that focuses on long-range warfare over close engagements. A capital ship of the Bashkmul, it is the backbone of their interstellar military force. In an effort to ensure that Bashkmul space is well-defended should the Pug attack again, the Bashkmul government has made the Howitzer available for civilians to purchase. This has increased the number of Howitzers in circulation and consequentially has made Bashkmul space an unattractive target for invasion, but has also had the unfortunate side effect of making it easier for pirates to get their hands on this ship."

	description `The Carrack has a long history - its predecessors were used as colony ships in the early days of Rigran space exploration, and the Rigra have still found its fundamental design useful hundreds of years later. Its most recent incarnations were intended as transports for the large numbers of Rigra in Bashkmul space, and given the high population density of the Rigra, many captains have found the Carrack to be a lucrative ship. Since the Pug War the Carrack has also been used to move Aert from their original three planets to an uninhabited group of systems west of Bashkmul space. The few jump drives that the Bashkmul have are all installed in these ships in an effort to move as many Aert west as possible.`
