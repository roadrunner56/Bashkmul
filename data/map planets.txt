planet Mernoth
	landscape land/industrial0-iridium
	description "As the nearest inhabited planet from Aert space, Mernoth was the site of first contact between the Aert and Rigra. As such, it was made the capital of the Bashkmul and has been widely settled by both species. Most cities on this planet have above and below-ground components, providing suitable habitation for both the Aert and Rigra. Like most Rigra planets, the vast majority of its surface area is inhabited; very little remains untouched."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is packed, even by Rigra standards. On the massive dome covering the spaceport's market is an enormous mural, depicting the Aert on one side climbing out of the ground, and the Rigra on the other side emerging from the ocean. They both ascend what you guess is some sort of staircase, meeting each other in the stars. It is difficult to make out as the mural is so faded and poorly maintained that most details have fallen away."

planet Shundosh
	description "This is the homeworld of the Aert, although looking at it from space you wouldn't realize it. The vast majority of the surface has been dedicated to farming, with most of the population living below ground. However, in the aftermath of the Pug war, the planet's ecosystem has been getting drier as Shundosh's star has expanded and aged. Farming has since moved to the poles, leaving the equator mostly barren. Desert life forms have begun to take over the abandoned farms there."

planet Hema
	landscape land/city4
	description "Despite being in Rigra space, you notice an abnormally large number of Aert wandering around. While the Aert are not typically adventurous, some who long for excitement and novelty come here to live with the Rigra. As such they have been strongly influenced by Rigran culture, and have even developed their own dialect as a result of their isolation from most of the Aert population."

	description "The first thing you notice about this ringworld is that the Quarg seem to be a minority here. This ringworld is filled with both Aert and Rigra desperate to escape their growingly inhospitable worlds. To accomodate as many of the Bashkmul as possible, the Quarg have doubled their efforts to expand this ringworld."
