planet Mernoth
	landscape land/industrial0-iridium
	description "This is the most populous world in Aert space outside of Valbona. As the nearest inhabited planet from the wormhole, it was the site of first contact between the Aert and Rigra. As such, it was made the capital of the Bashkmul and has been widely settled by both species. Most cities on this planet have above and below-ground components, providing suitable habitation for both the Aert and Rigra. As Frenoj is a young star, its planets have been spared the worst of the Pug destruction, and it still maintains some semblance of a normal ecosystem."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is far busier and full of life than most other Bashkmul worlds. On the massive dome covering the mercantile section is an enormous mural, depicting the Aert on one side climbing out of the ground, and the Rigra on the other side emerging from the ocean. They both ascend what you guess is some sort of staircase, meeting each other in the stars. It is difficult to make out as the mural is so faded and poorly maintained that most details have fallen away."

planet Lukainos
	description "Aert world #1."
	spaceport "The aliens here are mostly Rigra, though you spot an Aert or two. No matter the species, they all seem to be focused on you and your jump-drive equipped ship. Perhaps it it best if you don't spend too long here."

planet Hema
	landscape land/city4
	description "Despite being in Rigra space, you notice an abnormally large number of Aert wandering around. While the Aert are not typically adventurous, some who long for excitement and novelty come here to live with the Rigra. As such they have been strongly influenced by Rigran culture, and have even developed their own dialect as a result of their isolation from most of the Aert population."

planet "Prush Aert"
	attributes quarg
	description "Originally a fast-growing ringworld, Prush Aert was left mostly abandoned in favor of concentrating the Quarg's efforts on the construction of a ringworld in Rigra space."
	spaceport "This ring is far emptier than you would expect for a Quarg ringworld. Only a skeleton crew of Quarg remain, along with a handful of Aert that lack the distrust most of their species feels towards the Quarg. "

planet "Deika Rigra"
	description "This ringworld is filled with Rigra desparate to escape their growingly inhospitable worlds. To accomodate as many of the Bashkmul as possible, the Quarg have doubled their efforts to expand this ringworld."
